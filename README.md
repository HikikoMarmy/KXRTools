Tools for unpacking Onigiri KXR Files

## How To Use:
  1. Make sure that your game installation is fully up to date.
  2. Drag and Drop the selected KXR Files, or folder, on to KXRTools.

KXR Tools will automatically use an updated cobralaunch to unpack and name files.
 You can overwrite this behaviour by providing your own pkg.json when dragging files.
